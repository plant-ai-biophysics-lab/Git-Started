<h4><b> A walkthrough of the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab's git workflow. </b></h4>

## Motivation

Our lab aims to create high quality computational tools for solving basic and applied problems related to plants. To maximize efficiency and scalability, we apply a lightweight software engineering/analytics workflow built on Git version control. The documentation below introduces basic concepts, Git workflow procedures and code examples, and discusses more advanced topics like squash-rebase and merge conflicts.

Don't hesitate to help us improve this workflow by making suggestions or submitting a pull request.

## Terminology

Here are some of my loose definitions of basic git concepts...

<i>Agents</i>
- <b>Version control system</b>: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- <b>GitHub repository</b>: Often shortened to 'repo', a version controlled codebase.
- <b>GitHub organization</b>: A collection of team members and external collaborators that are working together to build one or more repos.
- <b>Member</b>: A person belonging to a GitHub organization.
- <b>Collaborator</b>: A person contributing to a given repo.

<i>Objects</i>
- <b>Codebase</b>: All of the code (and non-code) files that constitute your software.
- <b>Local</b>: The computer that you're currently working on.
- <b>Remote</b>: The computers maintained by GitHub in some server farm where you store all your repos.
- <b>Branch</b>: One of many possible active versions of a codebase, either local or remote.

<i>Actions</i>
- <b>Clone</b>: To copy a repository from the remote server to a local machine for the first time.
- <b>Pull</b>: To update a local branch based on the latest version on the remote server.
- <b>Status</b>: Tells you which files in your current branch are different from the remote server.
- <b>Add</b>: Stage files from your current branch for upload to the version on the remote server.
- <b>Commit</b>: Instate local changes and prepare for upload to remote server.
- <b>Push</b>: Upload changed and committed files to the remote server.
- <b>Checkout</b>: Switch to a different (either new, locally hosted, or remotely hosted) branch
- <b>Merge</b>: Combine two branches together. <b>This can be a little tricky!</b>


## Our basic workflow

We use a `master` <-> `dev` <-> `<feature_branch>` development workflow. Two branches, `master` and `dev`, require a pull request (PR) to one or more collaborators prior to merging new code (step 7 below). Contributors to a repo can create any additional number of `<feature_branch>` branches. These third-order branches are where new software features are born. We try to keep a 1:1 feature to branch mapping. That means each branch should be associated with *a single* feature. Prior to merging into the `dev` branch, and once you've tested your `<feature_branch>` code sufficiently, you can ask one or more collaborators to review it by making a PR. Following several merges of different `<feature_branch>` branches into `dev` it's probably worthwhile to merge `dev` into `master`. This event should be accompanied by releasing a new version, e.g. `v0.1`.

As an example, let's say that I want to develop a new software feature, called `our_basic_workflow`. I'll do the following:

1. Clone the repo, which starts as the `master` branch.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/plant-ai-biophysics-lab/git-started.git
```

You can grab the repo URL from the remote repo. For example,

![test image](images/clone_with_https_screenshot.png)

Examine the active branch and the other branches that are tracked locally.

```bash
$ git branch
```

2. Change into the `git-started` repo directory and checkout the existing `dev` branch from the remote.

```bash
$ cd git-started
$ git checkout dev
```

3. Checkout a new branch, called `our_basic_workflow` for instance, on your local machine.

```bash
$ git checkout -b our_basic_workflow

```

Again, examine the active branch and the other branches that are tracked locally.

```bash
$ git branch
```

4. CODE TEST CODE TEST CODE TEST. Once you've finished up a small chunk of code changes, it's probably a good idea to commit to the remote repo.

5. First, take a look at which files changed from the index file.

```bash
$ git status
```

6. Then, add updated files to staging area, commit with descriptive message, and push to remote repo (steps 5 and 6 below).

```bash
$ git add <insert-files-to-stage> # repeat this for each file
$ git commit -m 'Insert useful message here...'
$ git push origin our_basic_workflow
```

7. Submit a PR to a collaborator.

The easiest way to do this is through the online UI.

![new pull request](images/new_pull_request.png)

After click the button above, define what merge you are proposing, whom you want to review it, and the create the pull request.

![open pull request](images/open_pull_request.png)

8. Wait for PR approval or suggestions for edits from the proposed reviewers.

9. Once PR is approved, merge `our_basic_workflow` into `dev` branch on local.

To do this, following good practice, examine the active branch and the other branches that are tracked locally.

```bash
$ git branch
```

Assuming you are in the `our_basic_workflow` branch, check out the `dev` branch.

```bash
$ git checkout dev
```

Now, merge the `our_basic_workflow` branch into the `dev` branch.

```bash
$ git merge our_basic_workflow
```

This command merges from the specified branch, `our_basic_workflow` in this case, into the currently active branch `dev`.

10. Add, commit and push updated version of `dev` to remote. 

```bash
$ git add <insert-files-to-stage> # repeat this for each file
$ git commit -m 'Insert useful message here...'
$ git push origin dev
```

11. Delete local and remote copies of `our_basic_workflow` branch.

```bash
$ git checkout dev
$ git branch -D our_basic_workflow
$ git push origin --delete our_basic_workflow
```

12. Start again at step (3) with a new `<feature_branch>`.
